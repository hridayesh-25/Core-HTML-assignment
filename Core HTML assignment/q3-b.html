            Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications, 
            encompassing tasks such as front-end development for user interface and interactivity using 
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, back-end development for server-side logic and database management, 
            and the integration of frameworks and libraries for streamlined development. Full-stack 
            developers have expertise in both front-end and back-end aspects, while web design contributes 
            to the visual elements of a site. Responsive design ensures compatibility across devices, and 
            security measures safeguard against vulnerabilities. Content Management Systems facilitate 
            content administration. The field continuously evolves with technological advancements, 
            requiring developers to stay current for effective, secure, and user-friendly website 
            development.
